Canvas Sample
====================
This project demostrates the usage of the `defrac.display.Canvas` object.
It also shows how you can use the hotswap mode in order to develop code,
like a GLSL shader.

Start this sample in *hotswap* mode, then edit the code itself in the
canvas renderer or simply the shader.glsl file while the app is running
to see the changes instantly.
